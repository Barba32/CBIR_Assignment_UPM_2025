# CBIR_Assignment_UPM_2025
The application developed for the CBIR assignment of the 2025 course Information Retrieval, Extraction, and Integration. The creators are Adrián Barba Beltrán, Rodrigo Martín Gómez del Moral Herranz, César Pantoja Rosales, and Javier Rodríguez García.

## DATABASE:
Only a part of the database was used for the assignment: holidays_database and holidays_test
that are explained at the presentation and report. The original one is avaible in the Kaggle link
presented in this two documents, because it was too huge.


## INDEX:
The index previously created has been removed because of the weight.
To create it again only run the app in the terminal with the command: python main.py
It would take some time because of the quality of the images but will create the file: cbir_index.pkl
